# Ordinal Rollup
Ordinal Rollup chain is a Bitcoin-Native Layer 2 Smart Contract Chain powered by ordinal rollup inscriptions.

# **Abstract**

Ordinal Rollup aims to be the bridge that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and deploy smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain. Using a combination of Layer 2 scaling techniques inspired by Polygon and Ordinals inscriptions, Ordinal Rollup seeks to bring versatility to Bitcoin without compromising its foundational security.When you create a wallet or deploy smart contract, you get a BTC address.

## **1. Introduction:**

Bitcoin, being the pioneering blockchain, has remained largely as a secure peer-to-peer digital currency. Ordinal Rollup endeavors to expand its potential by providing a framework that lets developers introduce dApps and smart contracts.

## **2. Key Features:**

- dApp and Smart Contract Support: Ordinal Rollup is designed to fully support dApp development and the deployment of smart contracts, bringing enhanced functionality to Bitcoin.
- Scalability: Increased transaction throughput, making it suitable for dApps that require high frequency and volume.
- Security: Uses Ordinals inscriptions for periodic checkpointing onto the Bitcoin mainnet.
- Interoperability: Seamless interaction with BRC-20 tokens and existing Bitcoin protocols.

## **3. Architecture:**

- Ordinal Rollup Virtual Machine (BVM): Inspired by Ethereum's EVM, BVM will allow the execution of smart contracts on Ordinal Rollup.
- Validators: Nodes responsible for confirming transactions and contract executions on Ordinal Rollup chains.
- Ordinals Sync Module: Ensures that the state of Ordinal Rollup chains is periodically recorded onto the Bitcoin mainnet via Ordinals inscriptions.

## **4. Smart Contract Mechanism:**

- Deployment: Developers can deploy contracts on Ordinal Rollup, which are then executed by the BVM.
- Interactions: Contracts can interact with Bitcoin and BRC-20 tokens, enabling complex dApp functionalities on top of Bitcoin's security.

## **5. dApp Development Environment:**

- Ordinal Rollup SDK: A set of development tools to facilitate the creation of dApps on Ordinal Rollup.
- Token Integration: dApps can integrate with BRC-20 or introduce their own tokens on Ordinal Rollup.

## **6. Security:**

- Double Validation: Ensuring contract executions are valid on Ordinal Rollup and then confirming their state on the Bitcoin mainnet through Ordinals.
- Fraud Proofs: Mechanisms to challenge any incorrect state transitions or contract outcomes.

## **7. Future Work & Conclusion:**

Ordinal Rollup's vision is to evolve with the needs of the developer community and the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. We foresee a future where Bitcoin isn't just a digital gold but also a hub for innovative decentralized applications, and Ordinal Rollup will be the cornerstone of that vision.
