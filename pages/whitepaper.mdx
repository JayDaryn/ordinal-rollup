# Ordinal Rollup: Unleashing the Power of Bitcoin through Layer 2 Innovation
---

## Abstract
Ordinal Rollup introduces a groundbreaking Layer 2 solution built on the most secure and decentralized blockchain: Bitcoin. Aimed at overcoming Bitcoin's scalability and smart contract limitations, Ordinal Rollup enables the development of decentralized applications (dApps), digital assets, and tokens directly tied to BTC. By leveraging the security and decentralization of Bitcoin, Ordinal Rollup provides a robust platform for scalable, efficient, and innovative blockchain applications, making it the world's first truly decentralized Bitcoin-native AppChain powered by bitcoin ordinal rollups.

## Introduction
Bitcoin, the first and most secure blockchain, revolutionized the concept of digital currency. However, its design priorities—security and decentralization—limit its scalability and the direct implementation of smart contracts. As blockchain technology evolves, the need for scalable solutions that do not compromise on decentralization has become paramount. Ordinal Rollup represents a pioneering step towards this goal, offering a Layer 2 solution that enriches Bitcoin's functionality without sacrificing its core principles.
## Current state: We have Side-chains NOT Layer2s for Bitcoin


Platforms like RSK (Rootstock) make it possible to create smart contracts and token standards like ERC-20 on a platform that is anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. RSK is a smart contract platform secured by the Bitcoin network through merge-mining, allowing for the creation of decentralized applications with the security guarantees of Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism. RSK uses a sidechain that is pegged to Bitcoin, enabling the execution of smart contracts and the creation of tokens that can leverage Bitcoin's security and network effects.

it's worth noting that while RSK enables Ethereum-like smart contract functionality and token creation, all of this occurs on the RSK sidechain, not directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain essentially provides security to the RSK network through its hashing power, but the management of state, execution of smart contracts, and the specifics of token standards like BRC-20 happen within the RSK ecosystem.

## New Developments: The Ordinal Network


A more recent development that leverages the Ordinals protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain. Ordinals allow for the inscription of arbitrary data directly onto individual satoshis, the smallest units of bitcoin. This method effectively embeds data, including images, text, or code, into the Bitcoin blockchain in a way that was not previously emphasized. As a result, it has opened up new possibilities for creating token-like structures, NFTs, and other digital assets directly on Bitcoin, without relying on a separate smart contract platform like RSK.

### **How BRC-20 and Ordinal Inscriptions Work**

1. **Ordinal Inscriptions**: The Ordinals protocol numbers each satoshi in the Bitcoin supply sequentially, allowing for specific satoshis to be inscribed with additional data. These inscriptions are permanent and can include anything from simple messages to images, and potentially, executable code.
2. **Tracking and Managing State**: In the context of BRC-20 tokens or similar constructs that aim to utilize ordinals for tokenization, the state management would primarily depend on the ability to identify and verify the ownership and transfer of the inscribed satoshis. The state is inherently tied to the blockchain's transaction history, as ownership of a particular inscribed satoshi (and thus the data or "token" it represents) is transferred through standard Bitcoin transactions.
3. **Ownership Verification**: Ownership of a BRC-20 token or an NFT created through ordinals is verified through the possession of the inscribed satoshi. If a user controls a Bitcoin address that holds a satoshi inscribed with specific data (e.g., a token or NFT identifier), they effectively "own" that token or NFT. Transferring the token to another user involves sending the inscribed satoshi to the recipient's Bitcoin address.
4. **Token Transfer and Management**: The transfer of tokens or NFTs created with this method is constrained by the limitations and capabilities of the Bitcoin network's scripting language. While basic transfers of inscribed satoshis can be executed using standard Bitcoin transactions, more complex operations (like those common to ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens on Ethereum) may be challenging or infeasible due to Bitcoin's scripting language limitations.
5. **State Management Limitations**: It's important to note that while the Ordinals protocol and methods like BRC-20 can embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain, the blockchain itself does not natively support the complex state management and smart contract functionality found in platforms like Ethereum. As such, while ownership and transfers of inscribed assets can be managed through Bitcoin transactions, the ecosystem for managing these assets is inherently more limited than on platforms designed specifically for smart contracts and tokenization.

## OrdinalRollup: Creating a REAL Layer 2 (L2) solution for Bitcoin that leverages Ordinal inscriptions to implement a rollup-like mechanism.

Such a project would aim to combine the scalability and functionality of rollups (as seen in Ethereum's ecosystem) with the security and widespread adoption of Bitcoin. However, there are unique challenges and considerations to address given the fundamental differences in how Bitcoin and Ethereum are designed, especially in terms of smart contract capabilities and state management.

Given Bitcoin's scripting limitations and the unique capabilities of Ordinal inscriptions, designing a rollup strategy that works within these constraints requires innovative thinking and leveraging the strengths of Bitcoin. A viable approach would focus on simplicity, security, and leveraging off-chain computations with on-chain verifications to the extent possible. Here's a conceptual strategy for a rollup system using Ordinal inscriptions:

### **1. Basic Concept**

- **Off-Chain State Management**: Manage the rollup's state entirely off-chain, including account balances, transaction history, and any smart contract-like interactions. This off-chain state represents the L2 layer.
- **Ordinal Inscriptions for State Commitment**: Periodically commit the state or state transitions of the rollup to the Bitcoin blockchain via Ordinal inscriptions. This could involve inscribing a Merkle root or a cryptographic hash representing the current state or recent state transitions into a satoshi.

### **2. Transaction Processing**

- **Batch Processing**: Transactions within the rollup are batched and processed off-chain. This process involves updating the off-chain state according to the transactions' logic.
- **State Transition Proofs**: For each batch of transactions, generate a cryptographic proof that summarizes the state transition. This could be a simple hash of the transactions and the resulting state or, depending on the rollup's complexity, more sophisticated proofs.

### **3. State Commitment on Bitcoin**

- **Inscribing State Proofs**: Use the Ordinal protocol to inscribe the state transition proof onto a satoshi. Each inscribed satoshi acts as a timestamped, immutable record of the rollup's state at a specific point in time.
- **Verifiability**: Ensure that anyone can verify the integrity of the rollup's state by comparing the off-chain state or state transitions with the inscribed proofs on Bitcoin.

### **4. Withdrawals and Deposits**

- **Deposits**: Could be managed by sending bitcoins to a specific address or set of addresses associated with the rollup, with the transaction details indicating the intent to deposit into the rollup. The off-chain system would monitor these addresses and credit the corresponding rollup accounts.
- **Withdrawals**: More challenging without native smart contract functionality. One approach could be a withdrawal request within the rollup system, followed by an off-chain verification process. Once verified, the corresponding amount could be sent from the rollup's Bitcoin address(es) to the user's specified address.

### **5. Challenges and Considerations**

- **Dispute Resolution**: Without native smart contracts, enforcing dispute resolutions or fraud proofs becomes challenging. Solutions could involve off-chain arbitration with on-chain evidence submission via Ordinal inscriptions.
- **Security**: The system's security heavily depends on the integrity and security of the off-chain infrastructure managing the rollup.
- **Scalability vs. Bitcoin Block Space**: While this approach can increase transaction throughput relative to direct on-chain transactions, it still requires block space for state commitments. Efficient use of this space is essential.

### **6. Technical and Operational Infrastructure**

- **Node Network**: An off-chain node network to process transactions, manage the state, and generate state transition proofs.
- **Watcher Network**: A network of watchers that monitors for discrepancies between the committed on-chain state and the actual off-chain state, providing an additional layer of security.


## Ordinal Rollup Solution
Ordinal Rollup is designed as a Layer 2 solution that operates on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, providing a scalable and efficient platform for smart contracts and dApps while maintaining Bitcoin's decentralization and security. By timestamping blocks as inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, Ordinal Rollup ensures that its blocks are always in sync with Bitcoin, enabling a seamless and secure extension of Bitcoin's capabilities.

Bitcoin's scripting language, Script, is intentionally simple and not Turing-complete. This design choice prioritizes security and reduces the attack surface but limits the complexity of applications that can be directly built on Bitcoin, such as sophisticated smart contracts seen on platforms like Ethereum.

A Layer 2 solution could implement a more expressive and flexible smart contract environment that operates on top of Bitcoin. By handling complex computations and contract executions off-chain (or on the Layer 2) and then settling the final state on the Bitcoin blockchain, developers can create advanced decentralized applications without being constrained by the limitations of Script.

**Enhancing Scalability and Throughput**

Layer 2 solutions can significantly increase transaction throughput and reduce latency, which are critical for the practical use of blockchain for everyday transactions and interactive applications. Technologies like the Lightning Network, for example, allow for near-instantaneous transactions and microtransactions by enabling off-chain payment channels that only settle on the Bitcoin blockchain when the channels are opened or closed.

**Enabling Advanced Features**

With Layer 2, it's possible to introduce features that are not natively supported by the Bitcoin blockchain, such as:

- Complex Smart Contracts: Enabling sophisticated logic and programmable transactions that go beyond simple transfers of value.
- Privacy Enhancements: Some Layer 2 solutions can offer improved privacy features by keeping the details of transactions off the main blockchain.
- Tokenization and NFTs: Although Bitcoin does not natively support ERC-20-like tokens or NFTs as Ethereum does, a Layer 2 solution could provide the infrastructure necessary for these assets, potentially leveraging Bitcoin's security and network effect.

## Technical Architecture
At its core, Ordinal Rollup utilizes a novel block segmentation mechanism to facilitate fast and cheap transactions. This approach allows Ordinal Rollup to serve millions of customers without compromising on speed or cost. The chain's design also includes a robust timestamping mechanism, ensuring that all transactions and blocks on the Ordinal Rollup chain are verifiably in sync with the Bitcoin blockchain.


Drawing inspiration from Arbitrum's approach to creating a scalable, efficient Layer 2 solution for Ethereum, we can outline a technical plan for Ordinal Chain, a Bitcoin Layer 2 solution with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts, a native coin pegged to BTC's price, and a bridging mechanism for BTC. The goal is to provide scalability, enable smart contracts, and maintain tight synchronization with the Bitcoin base layer through inscriptions on individual satoshis.

**Technical Overview and Key Components**

Arbitrum's Approach: Arbitrum utilizes a "geth sandwich" architecture with Geth (go-ethereum) at the core for emulating EVM contracts and maintaining Ethereum state, surrounded by ArbOS for Layer 2 functions, and standard node software on top. This structure facilitates execution and proving by compiling the State Transition Function (STF) to WebAssembly (WASM) for dispute resolution, employing a general-purpose compression algorithm (Brotli) for data efficiency​​.

**Adapting for Ordinal Chain:**

- Core Layer (Geth Equivalent): Implement a Bitcoin node emulation layer to interpret and execute smart contracts within the EVM-compatible environment. This layer will interact with the Bitcoin blockchain for final state commitments.
- Middle Layer (ArbOS Equivalent): Develop a custom software layer, "OrdOS," to handle Layer 2 functionality, including transaction batching, smart contract execution, and cross-chain bridge functionalities. OrdOS will manage the intricacies of interacting with the Bitcoin network, such as inscriptions on satoshis for data anchoring.
- Top Layer (Node Software): Utilize existing Bitcoin node software with modifications to support EVM transactions, bridge operations, and interactions with the core and middle layers.
- Smart Contract Compatibility: Integrate EVM compatibility to enable developers to write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper, facilitating a smooth transition for Ethereum developers to build on Bitcoin. This requires the emulation of Ethereum's smart contract execution environment within the Ordinal Chain.
- Bridging Mechanism: Implement a secure and efficient bridging mechanism to allow users to lock BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint an equivalent amount of the native coin on the Ordinal Chain, maintaining a 1:1 peg. This process should be reversible, enabling users to burn the native coin on Ordinal Chain and unlock their original BTC.
- Data Compression and Optimization: Employ data compression techniques, similar to Arbitrum's use of Brotli, for efficient data storage and transmission. This will be crucial for minimizing the data footprint of Ordinal Chain transactions inscribed on the Bitcoin blockchain​​.
- Dispute Resolution Mechanism: Adopt a rollup strategy "Ordinal Rollup" similar to optimistic rollup with interactive fraud proofs for dispute resolution. This involves validators posting state updates to the Bitcoin blockchain, with a challenge period during which any incorrect claims can be disputed through a structured interactive proving process​​.
